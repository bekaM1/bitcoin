        "description": "Power Query for Power BI and Excel is a book for people who are tired of copying and pasting data into Excel worksheets. Power Query, part of the Microsoft Power BI suite, is a tool that automates the process of getting data into Excel and will save you hours of dull, repetitive, and error-prone work! Power Query makes it easy to extract data from many different data sources, filter that data, aggregate it, clean it and perform calculations on it, finally loading that data into either your worksheet or directly into the new Excel 2013 Data Model used by Power Pivot. This concise, practical book provides a complete guide to Power Query and how to use it to solve all of your Excel data-loading problems. Power Query for Power BI and Excel goes well beyond the surface of what Power Query can do. The book goes deep into the underlying M language, showing you how to do amazing things that aren’t going to be possible from just the GUI interface that is covered in most other books. You’ll have full command of the GUI, and you’ll be able to drop into the M language to go beyond what the GUI provides. The depth in this book makes it a must-have item for anyone who is pushing Power BI and Excel to their limits in the pursuit of business intelligence from data analysis. Teaches the basics of using Power Query to load data into Excel Helps you solve common, data-related problems with Power Query Shows how to write your own solutions in the powerful M language",

        "description": "There are millions of searchable data sources on the Web and to a large extent their contents can only be reached through their own query interfaces. There is an enormous interest in making the data in these sources easily accessible. There are primarily two general approaches to achieve this objective. The first is to surface the contents of these sources from the deep Web and add the contents to the index of regular search engines. The second is to integrate the searching capabilities of these sources and support integrated access to them. In this book, we introduce the state-of-the-art techniques for extracting, understanding, and integrating the query interfaces of deep Web data sources. These techniques are critical for producing an integrated query interface for each domain. The interface serves as the mediator for searching all data sources in the concerned domain. While query interface integration is only relevant for the deep Web integration approach, the extraction and understanding of query interfaces are critical for both deep Web exploration approaches. This book aims to provide in-depth and comprehensive coverage of the key technologies needed to create high quality integrated query interfaces automatically. The following technical issues are discussed in detail in this book: query interface modeling, query interface extraction, query interface clustering, query interface matching, query interface attribute integration, and query interface integration.

FQAS 2009 was preceded by the 1994, 1996 and 1998 editions held in Roskilde, Denmark, the FQAS 2000 held in Warsaw, Poland, the 2002 held in Copenhagen, Denmark, and the 2004 and 2006 editions held in Lyon, France, and in Milan, Italy, respectively. FQAS is the premier conference concerned with the very important issue of providing users of information systems with ?exible querying capabilities, and withaneasyandintuitiveaccesstoinformation.Themainobjectiveistoachieve more expressive, informative, cooperative, and productive systems which faci- tate retrieval from information repositories such as databases, libraries, hete- geneous archives and the World-Wide Web. In targeting this objective, the c- ference draws on several research areas, such as information retrieval, database management, information ?ltering, knowledge representation, soft computing, management of multimedia information, and human–computer interaction. The conference provides a unique opportunity for researchers, developers and pr- titioners to explore new ideas and approaches in a multidisciplinary forum. The overalltopic of the FQAS conferences is innovative query systems aimed at providing easy, ?exible and human-friendly access to information. Such s- tems arebecoming increasinglyimportantalsodue to the huge andalwaysgr- ing number of users as well as the growing amount of available information.",

This invaluable guide provides step-by-step instructions for investigating Internet crimes, including locating, interpreting, understanding, collecting, and documenting online electronic evidence to benefit investigations. Cybercrime is the fastest growing area of crime as more criminals seek to exploit the speed, convenience and anonymity that the Internet provides to commit a diverse range of criminal activities. Today's online crime includes attacks against computer data and systems, identity theft, distribution of child pornography, penetration of online financial services, using social networks to commit crimes, and the deployment of viruses, botnets, and email scams such as phishing. Symantec's 2012 Norton Cybercrime Report stated that the world spent an estimated $110 billion to combat cybercrime, an average of nearly $200 per victim. Law enforcement agencies and corporate security officers around the world with the responsibility for enforcing, investigating and prosecuting cybercrime are overwhelmed, not only by the sheer number of crimes being committed but by a lack of adequate training material. This book provides that fundamental knowledge, including how to properly collect and document online evidence, trace IP addresses, and work undercover. Provides step-by-step instructions on how to investigate crimes online Covers how new software tools can assist in online investigations Discusses how to track down, interpret, and understand online electronic evidence to benefit investigations Details guidelines for collecting and documenting online evidence that can be presented in court",

It tells the story of the impact of one of the most significant technological breakthroughs in Japan in the latter part of this century: the invention and rapid adoption of word-processing technology capable of handling Japanese script in a society where the nature of that script had previously mandated handwriting as the norm. The ramifications of this technology in both the business and personal spheres have been wide-ranging, extending from changes to business practices, work profiles, orthography and social attitudes to writing through to Japan's ability to construct a substantial presence on the Internet in recent years.",

        "description": "With the increasing popularization of personal hand-held mobile devices, more people use them to establish network connectivity and to query and share data among themselves in the absence of network infrastructure, creating mobile social networks (MSNet). Since users are only intermittently connected to MSNets, user mobility should be exploited to bridge network partitions and forward data. Currently, data route/forward approaches for such intermittently connected networks are commonly \"store-carry-and-forward\" schemes, which exploit the physical user movements to carry data around the network and overcome path disconnection. And since the source and destination may be far away from each other, the delay for the destination to receive the data from the source may be long. MSNets can be viewed as one type of socially-aware delay tolerant networks (DTNs). Observed from social networks, the contact frequencies are probably different between two friends and two strangers, and this difference should be taken into consideration when designing data dissemination and query schemes in MSNets. In this book, the fundamental concepts of MSNets are introduced including the background, key features and potential applications of MSNets, while also presenting research topics, such as, MSNets as realistic social contact traces and user mobility models. Because the ultimate goal is to establish networks that allow mobile users to quickly and efficiently access interesting information, particular attention is paid to data dissemination and query schemes in subsequent sections. Combined with geography information, the concepts of community and centrality are employed from a social network perspective to propose several data dissemination and query schemes, and further use real social contact traces to evaluate their performance, demonstrating that such schemes achieve better performance when exploiting more social relationships between users.",
